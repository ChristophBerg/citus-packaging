Description: HyperLogLog extension for PostgreSQL
 HyperLogLog is an algorithm for the count-distinct problem, approximating the
 number of distinct elements in a multiset. Calculating the exact cardinality
 of a multiset requires an amount of memory proportional to the cardinality,
 which is impractical for very large data sets. Probabilistic cardinality
 estimators, such as the HyperLogLog algorithm, use significantly less memory
 than this, at the cost of obtaining only an approximation of the cardinality.
